					<h4 class="titleLightGreen lg-mt-5 sm-mt-2">
						HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION	 
					</h4>
					<p>
						We use a variety of commercially reasonable safeguards to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction while it is under our control. Under our practices and policies, access to personally identifiable information is limited to those with a legitimate business need. Although we work hard to protect all personal information we collect and store, no data security measures are 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, alter, destroy, steal, or disclose personal information. Alysei maintains security and incident response plans to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to private information we collect or store. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk. 
						We retain information only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes.  When we dispose of personal information, we use industry standard procedures designed to destroy it or render it unreadable.
						If you become aware of a security issue, please contact us through appropriate channels.

If you disclose personal information in a publicly accessible place in the Site or App, you do so at your own risk and you understand that your submitted information may be collected and used by others to send you unsolicited messages, advertisements, or for other purposes.

California customers who wish to request further information about our compliance with this law or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices and policies may contact us.

					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="titleBlue">Notice to Non-U.S. Users.
						</span>
						Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so all personal data will be processed by us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as other parts of the world, such as the EU. If you create an account with Alysei as a visitor from outside the United States, by using our Services, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection as required in the EU or other countries. Regardless of where your information is processed and transferred from, we apply the same protections described in this policy.
