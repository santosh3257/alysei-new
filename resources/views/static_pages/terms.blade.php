If you elect to pay for Purchased Services, you understand that such Purchased Services are personal. You may not resell, transfer, or share access to your Purchased Services or account name and password with any other party.

We may store and continue billing your payment method even after it has expired to avoid interruptions in your Purchased Services and to pay for additional Purchased Services. When paying for subscription-based Purchased Services, your initial payment method will be saved and billed automatically at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. If a payment cannot be charged to your payment method or your payment is returned to us for any reason, we reserve the right to either suspend or terminate your access to the Purchased Services. 
					</p>
					<p>
